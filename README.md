# Decimal2Binary-Tool
The program prompts the user to input a decimal number. It then utilizes a function decimalToBinary() to convert the decimal number into its binary representation. The conversion process involves iterative division by 2 and storing remainders until the quotient becomes zero. Finally, the binary representation is displayed to the user.

Usage
To use this program:

Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
Enter a decimal number when prompted.
The program will output the binary equivalent of the entered decimal number.

Example
Enter a decimal number: 10
Binary equivalent: 1010
